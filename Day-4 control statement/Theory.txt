# Switch case:-
- Cases have to be the same type as expression, must be a constant or litera
- Duplicate case values are not allowed
- break is use to terminate the sequence
- if break is not used, it will continue to next case
- default will execute when none of the above does
- if default is not at the end, put break after it

# Syntax:-
class main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        switch(expression){
            case :
                statement;
                break;
            default:
                statement;
        }
    }
}

# ternary operator;
 # for each loop:-
 - whenever we don't have length and whenever we don't have index value, you have to use for each loop and after that 
 - mostly will use for each loop in collections 
Eg. list, set, map
